## Alternative: Base64 Embed (No images folder needed)

If you prefer to embed the logo directly in the code:

1. Convert your BUBT logo to Base64
2. Replace `images/bubt-logo.png` with:
   ```
   data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANS...
   ```

---

## Branding Consistency:

The logo now appears consistently throughout the application, reinforcing:
- Official BUBT branding
- Professional appearance
- University identity
- Trust and credibility

---

## Next Steps:

1. **Save your logo:** Place BUBT logo as `/images/bubt-logo.png`
2. **Test:** Open `index.html` in browser
3. **Done!** Logo will appear automatically everywhere

---

**Status:** ✅ **Ready to use!** Just add the logo image file.

**Note:** The application is fully functional with or without the logo. If the logo file is missing, the current design will gracefully handle it (the img tag will just not display, but everything else works perfectly).
